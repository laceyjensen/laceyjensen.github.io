    <h1>CSS and HTML</h1>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
<p>When leaning HTML, we were taught the basics when it comes to coding. These were things like learning about making headers, paragraphs, links, and adding quotes. We also learned how to add in images, videos, and audio. 
    Some other elements of HTML that we learned were things like commenting out code and making footers, which can be good for copyrighting your webpage and work.
When it came to practicing with HTML, we made practice sites, which I will include a picture of, and reviewed our classmates sites to learn from them and give feedback. 
</p>

<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>When it came to CSS, which is short for Cascading Style Sheet, we learned about the ways that you can personalize your pages and make them look more appealing. This came with things like changing fonts, text sizes, 
    and colors of the text and the webpage itself. CSS also allowed us to make boxes and have animations. When we were practicing CSS, we went through the basics of the CSS code and what to do with it, and then practiced 
    by making a webpage, which I included an image of at the top of this page. I included boxes, changed the font colors, and also added an animation to one of my boxes that made it change color.
