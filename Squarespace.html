<h1>Squarespace</h1>
<p>Along with using WordPress, we used Sqaurespace to learn another website building tool. On this page, I will go over what I liked and disliked about Squarespace, along with
    what I felt I did and did not do successfully. I used the trial site feature of Squarespace, so I'm unable to link my site, but I will include some images from my site.
    The pictures that I have inserted at the top and bottom of this page are screenshots from the Squarespace website that I made.

<h3>Squarespace assignment:</h3>
<p>For this assignment, we used Squarespace to make a website about a local business, our own business, or one that we came up with. I made my website about a candy shop near my 
    house called Lee's Candies. This candy shop has been in Boise since 1947, and has been a staple in my family's life for as long as I can remember. With my Squarespace website,
    I wanted to highlight some of the candies that this shop offers as well as their prices, include some information about the shop, including their social media pages, and 
    include their address for people who want to visit.
