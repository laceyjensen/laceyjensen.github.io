<h1>My journey to Web Design</h1>
<img src="comm.jpg">

<h2>MediaPro 303, Fall Semester 2022</h2>
<h3>About the class:</h3>
<p>In this class, the goal was to be able to teach us how to code and use other websites, such as WordPress and Squarespace, to be able to make our own sites. When it came to
coding, we learned the basics of HTML, and then went into learning about CSS. HTML creates the basics of a webpage, with things like text, headers, lists, links, adding images,
and general things like that. CSS has to do with the stylization of it and being able to change text size, fonts, colors for everything, adding boxes, and anything you can think
of for making your site pretty.</p>
<p>Before we started any actual coding, we went over basics of what the Internet is and how it works. We learned what HTML is, how it's used, and how it's helpful.
    We then got into the actal practic of HTML coding. We worked on that for a few weeks before moving onto CSS. In the midst of all of this, we practiced our coding on a 
    website called <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">FreeCodeCamp</a>, and this helped us to learn new codes while refreshing our memory on codes we learned in class.
</p>
<p>After we learned HTML and CSS, we moved onto using outside sites such as WordPress and Squarespace. In this website, you will see my journey with HTML, CSS, WordPress, and Squarespace. 
    As you navigate through each tab, it'll give you more information on what we did in class and what I made.

<br>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
