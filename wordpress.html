<h1>WordPress</h1>
<p>Another aspect of this class was using sites such as WordPress and Squarespace to make our own sites. I found success in using Wordpress despite some initial confusion, 
    and on this page I will explain my likes and dislikes with WordPress. I also will link my WordPress page for you to browse through.

<p><h2>Likes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It was easy to use and intuitive.</li>
        <li>It had a lot of templates that were available for use.</li>
        <li>I had a lot of control over what the pages looked like and what I could add in order to make them my own.</li>
        <li>It was easy to add images and links in it.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p><h2>Dislikes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Initially, it was challenging to create the home page.</li>
            <li>Creating a domain name was confusing when it came to if you had to pay or not.</li>
            <li>Publishing the site proved to be a bit of a challenge and also was confusing about payments.</li>
        </ul></p>
